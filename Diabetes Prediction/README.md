# Diabetes Prediction

## Desired Outcome
Machine learning system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not 

## Machine Learning Algorithm:
Support vector machine

## Project Info
### Support Vector Machine
is a supervised machine learning algorithm.

In supervised learning we feed the data to our machine learning model and machine learning model learns from the data and it is labels.

### Labels
Is the patient diabetic or non-diabetic.

### Model Training 
We train our model with several medical information such as the blood glucose level and the insulin of the patients
along with whether the person has diabetes or not.

Once we feed this data to our support vecter machine it trise to plot the data in a graph, and once it plots the data it tries to find a hyperplane, the hyperplane separates the two data 

### Hyperplane
What is hyperplane in ML?
Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes

## Work Flow
1- Diabetes Data 
2- Data pre Processing 
3- Training and Testing
4- Feed to The Support Vector Machine Model
5- Give a New Dataset to the Trained Machine 
6- Predict Whether The Patient Diabetic or Not
