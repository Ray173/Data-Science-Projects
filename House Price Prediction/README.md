# House Price Prediction

## Desired Outcome
Machine learning system that can predict a house price  

## Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning:  Train with lables 
2. Unsupervised Learning: Train without the lables 

### Supervised Learning 
1. Classification: Predicting a class or discrete value, True or False (1 or 0)
2. Regression: Predicting a quantity or continuous values, Salary, Age or Price

### Labels
Price of the houses

## Machine Learning Algorithm:
xt boost regression algorithm 

### XGBoost Regression Algorithm
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a popular supervised-learning algorithm used for regression and classification on large datasets. It uses sequentially-built shallow decision trees to provide accurate results and a highly-scalable training method that avoids overfitting.

In supervised learning we feed the data to our machine learning model and machine learning model learns from the data and it is labels.

## Work Flow
